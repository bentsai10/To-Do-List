<p><strong>To-Do List's purpose:</strong><br>Allow users to never forget a task again with notification feature, elaborate on their tasks with a note feature, and 
feel good when they finish a task with a checkbox feature.</p>

<h3> Using To-Do List</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Own a Mac (Sorry PC users :( )</li>
  <li>Download XCode</li>
  <li>To-Do List was created using XCode 11.6, so make sure you have that or a higher version!</li>
  <li>Go to the "Code" dropdown above and select "Open in XCode!"</li>
  <li>Never forget anything again! (Unless you forget to put the task on your to-do list)</li>
</ul>

<h3>How To-Do List Works</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Allow Notifications</li>
  <br>
  <p align = "center"><kbd><img src = "/images/notification_prompt.gif" height = "500"></kbd></p>
  <li>Add a task by naming it, enabling a reminder time should you need it, and write some notes if necessary</li>
  <br>
  <p align = "center"><kbd><img src = "/images/add_task.gif" height = "500"></kbd></p>
  <li>If you made a typo or want to add notes, you can always edit tasks and save them</li>
  <br>
  <p align = "center"><kbd><img src = "/images/edit_task.gif" height = "500"></kbd></p>
  <li>On the home page table view, you can also rearrange or delete your saved tasks</li>
  <br>
  <p align = "center"><kbd><img src = "/images/edit_delete_tasks.gif" height = "500"></kbd></p>
  <li>Get notified when it's time to complete your task</li>
  <br>
  <p align = "center"><kbd><img src = "/images/notification.gif" height = "500"></kbd></p>
  <li>When finished, feel good about yourself by checking that task off the list!</li>
  <br>
  <p align = "center"><kbd><img src = "/images/checked_task.gif" height = "500"></kbd></p>
</ol>
